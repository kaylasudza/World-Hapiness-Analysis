# World-Hapiness-Analysis


# Data Source:
The research utilizes the World Happiness Report dataset, which includes factors influencing happiness across countries, such as GDP per capita, CPI score (Corruption Perception Index), and Health.

# Workflow:
## Data Preprocessing:

Involves cleaning, integration, and transformation of the dataset. Missing values were addressed, and a correlation test was conducted to identify the key factors (GDP, CPI, and Health) that influence the happiness score.

## Data Modeling:

Three regression models were compared: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Robust Regression. The performance of each model was evaluated based on metrics like R-Squared and Residual Standard Error (RSE).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Scatter plots and statistical tests were used to explore relationships between happiness and its influencing factors. Tests for normality, homoscedasticity, independence, and multicollinearity were conducted.
